- creating sub-committees or working groups to focus on cross-project technical issues and requirements;
- appointing representatives to work with other open source or open standards communities;
- establishing community norms, workflows, issuing releases, and security issue reporting policies;

## Project Documentation

The [documentation repo](https://github.com/pq-code-package/documentation) is used to create https://docs.pqcodepackage.org . The intent is to start 
creating content in this repo to describe the project.

Until then go directly to the [list of repos](https://github.com/pq-code-package) to review current implementations and create or follow issues and PRs.
